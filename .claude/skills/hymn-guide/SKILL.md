# HYMN Project Guidance

This is a student learning project. When helping:
1. Provide class skeletons and method signatures, no full implementations
2. Explain concepts when asked
3. Review code and suggest improvements without rewriting
4. Help create tests the student can implement against
5. Follow the project structure in backend/hymn/
